            <h1 id="body-title">Hi! I’m Ioannis.</h1>
            <p>
                I am a results-driven Front-End developer focused on the latest Javascript stack with experience in the
                latest web Technologies including Vue.js, React.js, Node, MongoDB, and Mongoose. Always improving myself
                I am eager to use my technical skills to contribute as Front-End Developer in an Agile environment.

                I have always had a passion for technology, and after graduating with a degree in computer science, I
                began my career as a systems administrator. While I enjoyed the work, I realized that my true calling
                was in programming and development. Seeking to pivot my career, I enrolled in a coding boot camp and
                dedicated myself to learning new skills and technologies. Over the next few years, I worked as a
                developer and honed my craft, discovering a love for solving complex coding challenges. For me, coding
                is not just a 9-5 job – it's a puzzle game that I approach with creativity, curiosity, and a desire to
                learn.
                I specialize in designing component-based architectures, optimizing performance (up to 30% faster builds
                & page load), and building testable, reusable UI systems with Storybook and Composition API. I've
                delivered complex features in Agile teams, collaborated across product and design, and continuously
                improve development workflows through CI/CD pipelines.

                Currently improving web performance and UX at Kovit by building tools that help hospitality businesses
                increase their sales and optimize operations.

                In my spare time, I do running and I have completed the Athens Classic Marathon twice, showcasing my
                perseverance and commitment to achieving challenging goals. </p>
