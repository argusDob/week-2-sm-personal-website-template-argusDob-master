            <p>
                I am a results-driven Front-End developer focused on the latest Javascript stack with experience in the latest web Technologies including Vue.js, React.js, Node, MongoDB, and Mongoose. Always improving myself I am eager to use my technical skills to contribute as Front-End Developer in an Agile environment.</br></br>

                I have always had a passion for technology, and after graduating with a degree in computer science, I began my career as a systems administrator. While I enjoyed the work, I realized that my true calling was in programming and development. Seeking to pivot my career, I enrolled in a coding boot camp and dedicated myself to learning new skills and technologies. Over the next few years, I worked as a developer and honed my craft, discovering a love for solving complex coding challenges. For me, coding is not just a 9-5 job â€“ it's a puzzle game that I approach with creativity, curiosity, and a desire to learn.</br></br>

In my current role, I have played a pivotal role in redesigning the checkout flow, resulting in a more seamless and user-friendly experience for customers. Through my attention to detail and expertise in front-end development, I have consistently delivered high-quality results that exceed client expectations.
